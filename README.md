# Minimal Metadata Serialization

Minimal metadata serialization example for .NET Core

## What's it?

.NET Core natively supports metadata serialization with `System.Reflection.Metadata`. So, you can create a .NET Core assembly on disk and then load it dynamically and consume it.

## Why?

There weren't much examples online before creating this repository. So, this repository is created as an example. 

## What about serializing an `Assembly`?

If you want to serialize a dynamically generated `Assembly` at runtime, you can use [ILPacker](https://github.com/Lokad/ILPack).
